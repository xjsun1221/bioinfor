\title{draw a volcano plot}
\usage{
draw_volcano(deg, pvalue_cutoff = 0.05, logFC_cutoff = 1, pkg = 1,
  adjust = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{deg}{a data.frame created by Differential analysis}

\item{pvalue_cutoff}{Cutoff value of pvalue,0.05 by defult.}

\item{logFC_cutoff}{Cutoff value of logFC,1 by defult.}

\item{pkg}{a integer ,means which Differential analysis packages you used,we support three packages by now, 1,2,3,4 respectively means "DESeq2","edgeR","limma(voom)","limma"}

\item{adjust}{a logical value, would you like to use adjusted pvalue to draw this plot,FAlSE by defult.}
}
